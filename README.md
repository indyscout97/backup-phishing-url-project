# phishing-url-project
This project is being performed by MSBA students Jordan Waldroop and Jack Beck.
The goal is to work on improving a current URL phishing detection algorithm, which has the machine learning goal of creating a model that can predict whether or not a given URL will lead to a phishing website, based on the characters within the URL itself.

The original algorithm and associated datasets come from the following journal: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920313202

The current version of this algorithm has produced two dataset variations, one with 58,645 and the other with 88,647 labeled URLs.
It is very likely that we will continue to add other various datasets to our project to help improve our model performance.
Thank you to the original authors of the data article for paving the way for our project.
This project is a WIP and will be updated over time.
